            Oh well done! you found her!
            She was chilling by the sea!
            Trumpet in hand, writing solo songs,
            Celebrating her individuality!
            
           
            However, Piet is still preoccupied
            So I still need your support!
            It seems that once again
            Jenny has misplaced her passport!
            
            
            She’s checked here there and everywhere,
            But its nowhere to be found,
            She’s also lost her keys, her trumpet and her phone,
            Can you try and help us look around?
            
             
            They are somewhere hidden in the house,
            It will need more than just a glance,
            I’ve already asked the aunties for help
            But with their eyesight we didn’t stand a chance!
