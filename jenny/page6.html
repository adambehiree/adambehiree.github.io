            Congratulations for finding them,
            And for cracking Piet’s crafty code,         
            It seems that he’s been hiding things,            
            When poor Jen has been on the road!


                        Everyone thought that she was being forgetful,            
            But that really wasn’t the case!
            Piet’s been up to his tricks as usual
            And then left without a trace!

            
            Now that we’ve found all of Jen’s essentials
            We need to help her prep for a show!
            I think Piet’s been messing around with her trumpet
            I need to you see and give it a blow!
